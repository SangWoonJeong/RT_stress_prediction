# Predicting patient stress during radiation therapy

## Introduction
This repository shares code for predicting the stress of patients undergoing radiation therapy. It predicts patient stress during radiation treatment based on biometric signals collected before the therapy. Various models have been used to compare the prediction performance.



## Models

The models used in our research are:
- **DT (Decision Tree)**
- **RF (Random Forest)**
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
- **Transformer**
- **ChatGPT Fine-tuning**
- **ChatGPT Prompt engineering**


## Repository Structure

- **data/**: exmaple dataset
- **src/**: model source, package
- **results/**: Stores the results and performance metrics of the models.
- **checkpoints/**: saved models.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SangWoonJeong/RT_stress_prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd RT_stress_prediction
    ```

## Results

The results section will include the performance metrics for each model under the specified delay times. This may include accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
